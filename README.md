# Basic-Counter-Words
I need a repository to store the programs that I made in order to learn py ,nothing biggie for now. Oh, and it is a counter of words, really basic just an operator and a function and assignation 

# STRING METHODS
# .upper() = it converts on uppercases the string that we put on it
# .strip() = delete all the empty spaces in a string
    #but we can also use it to delete certain value(s) from the strings = "abc".string("a") = "bc"
# .count() = we put it an argumento to the method and it tell us how many times it does repaet itself on the string
# .bit_length() = it tell us how much of computer's memory is used by an integer = (99).bit_length() = 7
    # the parenthesis surronding the numner is necessary in order to execute the operation

line = input()
total_words = line.count(" ") + 1
total_words


#FUNCTION = similar to a method, we call it, with some arguments and returns a value,
    #it doesn't use the dot operator. All info is passed to functions is through arguments
# input() = it's use it to enter values into the program that you made in this case inputs strings
    #we can use variables in order to store the values that we gave to the like = line = input()

line = input()
total_words = line.count(" ") + 1
total_words
